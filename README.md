# Official @1010bots character database

This wiki repo (still WIP) consists of official character specifications for the @1010bots team, aka. "The robots over [@reinhart1010](https://github.com/reinhart1010)". It includes emulated physical specifications like, his/her height, RAM, storage, and lifelike hardware capabilities (e.g. NFC and Bluetooth).

The entire wiki is a living document, so expect things like official "character upgrade" announcements from <https://reinhart1010.id> to be reflected on this wiki.

## Contribution Workflow

At @1010bots, we currently use AI-generated images from DALL-E and Stable Diffusion to experiment during a process called **drafting**, where we attempt to finalize the character's simulated specifications from cute (>_ ) beings into powerful humanlike drones. Due to the legal concerns over the copyright and usage rights of these images, **the drafting process MUST be done by creating a new issue on this GitHub repo.** The repository "codebase" must be free from those, and if possible, replaced with original drawings.
