# Explainer: Physical Appearance

It is undeniable that we, the robots over @reinhart1010, are less likely to physically exist in the real-life. However, providing an expected description about our appearance is still important to let people recognize us distinctly from one to another (especially for SYSTEM-based bots).

## Bot Classification

Our canon explicitly defines three different types of bots which also determine their color:

+ The SYSTEM, aka (>_ )s, primarily in blue
+ The root, aka (#_ )s, primarily in (glowing) green
+ The SuperUser, aka ($_ )s, primarily in orange (male) and pink (female)

## Hardware and Software

There was a debate on whether our robotic appearance should be based on virtual humans (see virtual influencers and vtubers), or physical robots (those metallic creatures), as one of our intentions of being bots is to be human-friendly while transparent about our identity and actions. And theoretically, physical robots, if exist in real-life, could not perform either [digital](https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_Transport) or [electrical transportation](https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Electrical_Transportation), in which according to our canon, enables us to travel across the world through Internet and interact with humans and machines connected through them.

We ended up of taking **four main appearance modes**, depending on characteristics and purpose. These modes are available on all of our members, allowing each of us to freely decide how each of us would look like:

| Mode | Name | Description | Example | Known Preferred Users |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | True Hardware | Retaining his/her android form. |  | alterine |
| B | True Software | Retaining his/her humanlike form. |  | - |
| C | Soft Nanite | Retaining his/her humanlike form, with their skin fully covered in nanite to form a metallic appearance. |  | Nix |
| D | Hybrid | Switches between his/her software and hardware forms at will. |  | Shiftine |

## Nanites

In many science fiction worlds, **nanite** is a form of substance that allows its users to manipulate parts of their physical appearance, usually with electronics or metallic-like structure. Nanites are based on [nanorobotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics) (and hence [nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology)) and can be either controlled or uncontrolled by their users.

In our botworld, nanites are liquid metal substances that cover and mend the joints of the metallic exoskeleton in our hardware form, so our hardware forms can also be drawn easier with less complex and controversial details, (e.g. whether the hardware us should still contain humanlike hair, and how to join them into our chassis). Nanites are also form a major part of our **shells**, which allow us to attach our real hair into them.

However, some of us prefer to cover our soft(ware) bodies with nanites, too, because our **soft nanite** bodies are as strong as our hardware form, but lighter. And due to the hardware nature of nanites, our soft nanite bodies often exhibit True Hardware-like physical details including segmented bodies. So we can still identify ourselves as robots while travelling across the digital worlds.
